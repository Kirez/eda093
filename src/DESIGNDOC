			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

L1 We spent about 13 hours each

L2 We applied pair programming. Which means that we both were 
involved in all parts of the program and we therefore took turns writing the code.

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
It was a reasonable assignment, but it was structured in a way that it was hard to understand what was wanted at first,
since the text at pingpong is a bit messy.
For example it seemed at first that the forking of child processes were to be made in a recursive function. It became clear that
either way was fine though.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
Pipes was really hard in the beginning but after getting through it we have gained alot of insight in how that part work.
Working with pipes and the dup2 system call gave insight into how file descriptors work in POSIX.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?
Spending time figuring out the structure of the assignment on pinpong.
There was more than enough information about the assignment in the downloadable pdf. There were some helpful tips on
pingpong though, but it could have been clearer that this was extra help rather than nessecary info.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
Make a point of telling future students the importance of the provided code in our case this was the parser part.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?
We could have made use of a more clear help queue during labs, for when you need more help than you signed up for in 
the doodle.

>> Any other comments?
None.
